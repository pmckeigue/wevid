\title{Compute area under the ROC curve according to model-based densities}
\usage{
auroc.model(densities)
}
\arguments{
\item{densities}{Adjusted densities computed by
\code{\link{Wdensities.fromraw}}.}
}
\value{
The area under the model-based ROC curve computed from the densities of the
weight of evidence in cases and noncases.  This model-based ROC curve is always
concave (if the densities have been adjusted to make them mathematically consistent).
}
