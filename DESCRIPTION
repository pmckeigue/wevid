Description: The distributions of the weight of evidence (log Bayes factor) favouring case over noncase status in a test dataset (or test folds generated by cross-validation) can be used to quantify the performance of a diagnostic test. This package can be used with any test dataset on which you have computed prior probabilities of case status, posterior probabilities of case status, and you have the observed case-control status.  In comparison with the C-statistic (area under ROC curve), the expected weight of evidence (expected information for discrimination) has several advantages as a summary measure of predictive performance. To quantify how the predictor will behave as a risk stratifier, the quantiles of the distributions of weight of evidence in cases and controls can be calculated and plotted.
